# Azure Data Engineering Project - Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data Pipeline

This project creates a real-time cryptocurrency data pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate data ingestion, transformation, and storage in Delta Lake. The pipeline extracts data from the CoinGecko API, uses Autoloader for efficient data ingestion, leverages Unity Catalog for data governance, and integrates Azure Key Vault for secure management of secrets.
